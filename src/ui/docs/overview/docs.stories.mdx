This documentation is organized into the following main sections.

## Specs

Specifications for underlying rules that determine how UI components should be implemented.

- Borders

## Components

UI components implement the design specs and provide a foundation to compose advanced UI layouts. Each component includes documentation of props, usage and behaviors. Source code can be previewed in relating examples by accessing the `Show code` button.

Components are organized into categories based on functionality:

- **Core**: components that are used to build every other component.
- **Feedback**: components that provide visual feedback on its status (e.g. success/error).
- **Input**: components that accept user input.
- **Interaction**: components that are interactable or provide visual interaction feedback.
- **Layout**: components that organize content.
- **Navigation**: components that allow users to navigate to other content.
