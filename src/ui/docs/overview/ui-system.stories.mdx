# UI System

> _`system`_: a regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole.

The **UI System** is a collaborative effort maintained and evolved by designers, product, and developers.

This _progressive documentation_ describes a _system of design specs and UI components_ that empowers designers, product, and developers to build consistent and well-behaved UIs with speed and scale.

We will cover more details in the following sections:

- **Quick Start**: learn how to use components and features of the system.
- **Process**: an overview of the process that maintains the system.
- **Docs**: how to use the docs
